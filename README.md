**ABOUT graphics.h**:

The graphics.h library is part of the old Borland BGI (Borland Graphics Interface) and is used to perform simple graphical
operations in C and C++ programming. Although it's not commonly used in modern development due to its limitations and lack
of portability, it can still be a fun way to learn about basic graphics programming.

Just a practice.
